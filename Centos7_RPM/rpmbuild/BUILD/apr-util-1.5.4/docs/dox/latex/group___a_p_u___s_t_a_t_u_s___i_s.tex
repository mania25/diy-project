\begin{DoxyWarning}{Warning}
For any particular error condition, more than one of these tests may match. This is because platform-\/specific error codes may not always match the semantics of the P\-O\-S\-I\-X codes these tests (and the corresponding A\-P\-R error codes) are named after. A notable example are the A\-P\-R\-\_\-\-S\-T\-A\-T\-U\-S\-\_\-\-I\-S\-\_\-\-E\-N\-O\-E\-N\-T and A\-P\-R\-\_\-\-S\-T\-A\-T\-U\-S\-\_\-\-I\-S\-\_\-\-E\-N\-O\-T\-D\-I\-R tests on Win32 platforms. The programmer should always be aware of this and adjust the order of the tests accordingly.
